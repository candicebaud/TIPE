# Modelling of an epidemic's spread with a lockdown strategy and its consequences on food insecurity
This repository contains my first project in Python done in 'Prépa' (2nd year of studies in France after high-school). I gave an oral presentation in order to enter Centrale-Supélec, Mines de Paris and other engineering schools. I was awarded the grade 17.9/20.

The goal of the project was to simulate a pandemic, and adapt its spreading with lockdowns to mimic governments' policies. Once a country is in lockdown, we assumed difficulties to export or import and a disminished production (due to lack of workers). The simulation shows the different dynamics across countried and reveals the interdependencies on wheat.
